*A game I created for Halloween 2025*

A mischevious ghost is carelessly flinging ghostfire everywhere! Use your cauldron to catch and put out the fires before they hit the ground!
One mistake and it's Game Over. Reach 1000 points to defeat the prankster.

## ASTEROIDS

*Final project for python game development workbook*

Essentially the classic game of asteroids. The player controls a ship which is capable of the following:


- $\rightarrow$ | Rotate clockwise
- $\leftarrow$ | Rotate counter-clockwise
- $\uparrow$ | Thrusters
- $\mathrm{SPACE}$ | Fire Missles

The goal of the game is to destroy all asteroids on screen to proceed to the next level. The game ends when the player's ship has collided with an asteroid.
